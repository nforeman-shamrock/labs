# Project Set Up
## Introduction
This folder contains the scripts needed to set up and run this lambda locally. This is a somewhat messy way of doing this
as I do not know the proper way manage a rust projects tooling *yet*. There is not quite a corollary to npm scripts so there is 
not really a convenient place to store these kinds of things - as far as I can tell. This might just become a makefile at some point
in the future. 

## Script order
 install.sh
 build.sh
 start.sh - (in seperate terminal)
 run.sh

 Again, this is a somewhat garbage way to run this, and will be updated at some point in the future.
